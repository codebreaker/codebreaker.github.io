        <p>This was a test for a possible puzzle to be included in another game but has since evolved into its own
            little
            game.</p>
        <p>In early versions of the game there were three colours in the combination which increased to four in the
            later
            versions. The difficulty is the same in all versions.</p>
        <p>Here is how to play:</p>
        <p>The player tries to guess the pattern, in both order and colour, within the turns allowed by the difficulty
            level.</p>
        <p>When the player finishes one turn, the computer provides feedback by telling the player how many of the
            colours
            are correct but in the wrong position and how many colours are correct and in the correct position.</p>
        <p>If the player guesses the correct colours in the correct order the player wins, if not the game advances to
            the
            next turn or ends if there are no more turns.</p>
